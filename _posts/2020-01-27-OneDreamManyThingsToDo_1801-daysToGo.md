Dear “me after 5 years”,

Today, I tried to implement agile way of software development using online tools like [JIRA](https://happilypresents.atlassian.net/), Git, Circle CI, Heroku. My first step was to call a REST api from an Angular client and allow users to mark favorite photos to create a moment. Using VS code, I installed angular cli & dotnet core framework. I spent a couple of hours to fix the CORS error; I referred the code [here](https://angular.io/generated/zips/http/http.zip) and resolved the same.

I have to submit three assignments in the week-2 of [Machine Learning in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). I am a very big fan of [Andrew\_Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) and started following [Rachel Thomas](https://twitter.com/math_rachel) and [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward). I am learning new concepts in Machine Learning and also finding time to build an app. Planning to dockerize the micro services and deploy it in my local Kubernetes. In Machine learning, I understood the concept of feature scaling using mean normalization. In the review test there is a question to find out the normalized form of x(i, j) I was getting confused with ‘i’ and ‘j’ as former stands for rows(input) and later is column(feature)

I need to return to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions but can’t find enough time, seems there are lot of excitement and fun. I have completed micro courses in Python and Intro to Machine Learning. As there are lot of materials around machine learning sometime getting diverted. I decided to focus on the Coursera and completed the certification after week 11 will resume Kaggle. I have submitted Kaggle’s [Titanic Machine Learning Competion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and my current leader board ranking is 6813. I will find time to improvise this in the first quarter. Also I am half way through the [Google Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) but put on hold as its kind of diversion now.

I am trying to prepare myself to learn 6 hours a day, but unable to make it. I know I need to organize myself and pick one topic evolve from it. As I see lot of technology growth, I fear that I will be left behind if I don't find space with it. I dream of a day where I just code and checkin to git, its get deployed to Heroku via Circle CI. Today I have a couple of errors and one dream, hope I could get it done by end of this week.
